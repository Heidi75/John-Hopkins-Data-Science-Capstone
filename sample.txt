Cut a piece of sturdy nostretch string about inch shorter for really big buttons maybe ” shorter than the proposed button band determine desired number of buttons then subtract from that number and fold the string into that number of sections example for total buttons so fold the string into equal sections mark each of the three resulting folds with a pin straighten the string the top and bottom button are to be centered on the very ends of the string and the intervening three buttons are to be centered on each pin in the string segment measure each string segment to figure out how many inches of band to allow between the holes if using vertical buttonholes remember that the pin shows the buttonhole center not bottom so start the actual buttonhole accordingly

Before the industrialization of chicken production and the creation of broiler breeds of chicken only young spring chickens pullets or cockerels would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer older tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures to compensate for this sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender allowed to cool and dry and then fried this method is common in australia another method is to fry the chicken pieces using a pan fried method the chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid usually a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in this process of flouring frying and simmering in gravy is known as “smothering” and can be used for other tough cuts of meat such as swiss steak smothered chicken is still consumed today though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens or who seek out stewing hens it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens

I can’t specifically tell you when i came to my path but i can point at most of the things that led to it my father was something of a cross between agnostic and atheist but certain…attitudes were ingrained in me a love and respect for nature a habit for recycling not bowing before someone just because they think they are your spiritual superior in grade and middle school i went to a small episcopal church and the father there encouraged my questions and didn’t think my age should have any influence on my desire to learn and to serve in high school i had a “born again” experience the church i went to initially focused upon having the most dynamic and personal spirituality possible at the time i was also on the speech and debate team…so certain “habits” and “skills” were learned at one point i toured over the summer with the continental singers a christian ministry group their training program had me memorizing over a thousand bible verses…the verse the context it was taken from in the passage and the general “counseling” category it fit into their training also taught me about other faiths and how to witness my faith with honesty respect and questions much like if you were simply having a conversation with a friend when my home church shifted its focus towards “simply” converting the masseswinning over numbers i left because of the hypocrisy but maintained my faith over the next couple of years after graduating i continued to pursue and question my beliefs and path if i found something that worked it was incorporated if something no longer worked it was discarded one day a friend brought me into a pagan book store in new york and i came to the realization that i was pagan i was rather surprised and had and have no clue when specifically it happened that realization was in late ’ my love of theology has only increased since then

Why the siren likes it its a masterpiece thats why one that belongs on any list of the great films of the s a master class in how to make a movie about misguided surfacefocused people trapped by a hypocritical society without condescending to or withholding compassion from them the proof is that years after its release the thwarted motherdaughter love still reduces many to tears the siren bristles when she hears this described as camp there isnt a single unintentional effect in it the falseness and glitter are there to throw race this countrys original sin into high relief but sirk doesnt invite the audience to feel superior he wants recognition and he wants identification in the superb opening scene on the beach when lana turner reacts with gooey middleclass understanding to juanita moores having a whiteskinned daughter sirk didnt want the white liberals in the audience to say what a hypocrite he wanted them to say shit thats me the beautiful screen cap is from ways of seeing the sirens new blog discovery several others equally enthralling right here

Speaking of less than cooperative someone needs to open a potty training boot camp other than me it is a gold mine waiting to happen i apologize profusely to the friends that i offered potty training advice to bc before child potty training children at school is so much different than trying to potty train one at home its easier at school reallybecause they are all doing it mine could care less ive tried all my tricks nothing works stickers mms big boy underwear diapers pullups toys other bribes going every minutes to an hour potty dances reading books singing songs watching videos running the water decorating the bathroom etc nothing works the only thing i have left is to let him run around naked i have heard this works i am still debating whether it is worth it i really think diapers arent that expensivebut in all honesty if someone will take my child now and potty train him within a month i would pay hundreds of dollars yes seriously have you tried to potty train lately we started so long ago i cant even remember when we started i began when the books say to he started showing interest he learned quickly the purpose of sitting on the potty he pees every time he sits in fact hes so good at it he can pee stop then two minutes later pee again to try and convince me he deserves more candy and another sticker the problem is he is convinced he has better things to do and finds the convenience of peeing on himself better than sitting on the potty for two minutes i have tried to convince him it takes me longer to change his diaper but really he just doesnt care did i mention hundreds of dollars anyone

Finally a quick tip on the green onions i used my mothers trick with these and it worked perfectly for this recipe since the onions arent intended to be eaten just to add flavor it saved some time and clean up afterward take the length of white part place the tip of your knife almost at the very end of the onion farthest away from you and slice it lengthwise down the middle all the way through it should still be held together at the very tip turn it ° and perform the same action the length of onion should now be opened up like a flower toss the whole thing in the pot and repeat with the others when done cooking fish them out easily

But we also know that an entire universe of spiritual issues clusters around money there was a reason why jesus talked far more about money and possessions than he ever did about prayer or faith when a pastor asks a congregation to support a capital campaign or a christian agency asks the same of its constituency the people are actually being invited to examine the depth of their spiritual commitment a faithbased campaign is therefore best seen as an opportunity for spiritual renewal what better way to launch that renewal than by engaging the people in prayer

…i want to talk about an issue that missouri has already addressed in a variety of ways – the issue of illegal immigration i’m sure you’ve seen the headlines about arizona’s new law aimed at dealing with those who enter our country illegally it has been called the strictest immigration law in generations while missouri hasn’t gone to the same lengths as arizona our state has made significant policy changes that effectively deal with illegal immigrants who enter our state because of those changes missouri is ahead of the game when compared to many other states that are now dealing with this issue
“most mainline protestant churches are to one degree or another postchristian if they no longer seem disposed to converting the unbelieving to christ they can at least convert them to the boggiest of soft left political cliches on the grounds that if jesus were alive today he’d most likely be a gay anglican bishop in a committed relationship driving around in an environmentally friendly car with an “arms are for hugging” sticker on the way to an interfaith dialogue with a wiccan and a couple of wahhabi immams”

I left mcs thirtyfive years ago this morning i returned for the first time i went back not only to see what’s changed over the past three decades but to see what hasn’t changed i walked through the big green doors of the converted townhouse into the courtyard and up the spiral staircase to attend an alumni breakfast and take a tour of the school there’s a computer room there now but that room used to be a terrace and suddenly reverberating over the tapping of keyboards was the smack of my pink rubber handball hitting the brick wall and bouncing to derrick from the kitchen i was sure i could smell consuela’s chili and rice in the library my face suddenly flushed at the embarrassment of being made fun of by david just there at that table by the window in the round classroom i tasted the sweet dust from the sugar cubes we’d pasted together to make igloos as i walked down the back staircase i heard my own voice calling to my friends—nicole nina betsy maria leslie—in a race to see who could line up the fastest to go to the park with doc in the glorious woodpaneled music room morning light streaming in the tall windows i was sixyearsold again singing “we shall overcome someday” and in a corner of a small classroom with a blue rug surrounded by fabric and glue and cardboard and pencils and crayons i smelled the elmer’s and felt the textured brown fabric that were to become my first handmade book—magic moon and magic sun

“everything is acceptable no matter what it is” as much as i am in favor of religious freedom i always get angry when i happen on this sentence again on one side it’s nice – you can do whatever seems right for you even if it looks wrong to you but try getting more exact response and you don’t know if just laugh or cry we are like neutered to have an opinion or accept history as factual evidence i often see this in writing communities too – do whatever you want how is that helpful to anyone we don’t learn from it we’re left to sink in that mud hole others call street but crossing it is even harder because others won’t help us to the house we need to go and all this together we’ll be late for our appointment

I have worked out the guia de bolsillo which is singularly userunfriendly to my knowledge there is no map where you could see through which streets the buses actually pass from the guía you only get a rough idea of the neighbourhood that they are passing through but you cannot tell which streets nor where the stops are and since most streets in buenos aires are oneway when you arrive somewhere and want to take the same line back you must face the challenge of finding the bus stop in the opposite direction which can be just about anywhere it is a tricky business but not altogether impossible with the massive cooperation of the locals who mostly give you loads of interesting but unfortunately not entirely relevant information about other bus stops

The costs to an author to purchase any of the books are again pretty straight forward for a – average page paperback book selling at – the author gets that is of the list price less the print cost and a taking by aventine that again averaging about per book regarding royalties for the author it is the list price minus the print cost and the additional amount a third party seller like say amazon might take that can be anything up to with aventine the books by most standards are competitively priced because aventine has not chosen to inflate the costs of book production and printing the profits are actually small for them in fact so far i don’t know another author solutions service that comes to mind making so little on the books they publish on this note if you are thinking of going with aventine be aware they do not have an online bookstore all your books will be sold through thirdparty sales

Trimming or pruning of some of your trees and shrubs can be done at this time basically it breaks down like this if the tree or shrub flowers before the st of june don’t touch it now if it flowers after the st of june you can safely cut it now resist the urge to cut back everything most perennials benefit from a layer of mulched dead leaves if you had any fungus or disease problems in an area go ahead and cut back the plants in that area and rake up the debris mulch any plants that need extra protection like those hardy banana trees keep your ornamental grasses up until midmarch i’ll let you know when it’s time to cut them back

Why why why do artists create artworks featuring themselves that would be a good way to put it too lots of artists create selfportraits to try their hand at drawing painting etc themselves lots of artists render themselves to leave visual evidence of their artistic existance lots of artists create portraits of themselves because they figure if they can draw houses other people grass animals squares n circles why not draw their own dang self lots of artists render themselves so that they can look at it and be like “i look so cool much cooler than i do in life” imagine albrecht durer for example looking at his selfportrait below in saying in modern american english slang “ i look awesome germany give it up for ya boy my a can paint”

Gallstones subsequent gall bladder removal – in roughly november of i had severe indigestion and upper abdominal pain for about four months doctors at an urgent care facility the one of it’s kind here at the time kept telling me that my blood work didn’t indicate the need for an ultrasound because they are so hard to do right to look for gallstones i was repeated told i had ibs irritable bowel syndrome and given medication that never worked but one day roughly february the pain was so bad and so high up the only thing i could think to describe it was that i felt like i was having a heart attack i knew i wasn’t having a heart attack i was only years old at the time for crying out loud so for safety’s sake my husband called an ambulance their initial ekg showed nothing wrong which we expected and they took me to the emergency room the doctor there basically said he knew exactly what was wrong and skipped waiting on the blood work to come back and brought in an ultrasound machine yup my poor gall bladder was filled to the rim with stones i told the doctor what the other doctors had said and he was actually pretty pissed he gave me some pain pills and referred me to a gi doctor a short time later i was admitted to the hospital for surgery to remove my gall bladder i was pretty much told that was the standard and only way to deal with gallstones i had it removed i was shown acornsized stones that had filled my gall bladder over the past few months to the brim everything had gone well and i thought that was over boy was i wrong a few years ago when i began delving into natural remedies i read that there ways to rid of gallstones without surgery i was like “okay coolness too bad i didn’t know this then” but when we saw the nutritionist for the first time she explained that despite what modern conventional medicine says yes we do need our gall bladders she explained that without it my liver has been overworked and unable to properly digest my food namely fats all my food was being digested the same way no matter what cholacol bile salt supplement from standard process was added after my first evaluation was complete and the difference was amazing i will have to take cholacol the rest of my life now while i’m glad i have this option as a prepper i hate knowing i will be forever dependent on something i can’t get easily on my own aside from that once this lifestyle change and healing is complete it will be the only thing i’m on all my conventional modern medications are now gone and i couldn’t be happier about that so as with the adenomyosis and endometriosis above if you have gallstones please contact me before opting for surgery i’ll find some resources for you to look at to see about trying to get rid of those bad boys without resorting to unnecessary surgery sigh obligatory disclaimer no i’m not a doctor

The important thing is to choose your attitude negative attitudes have a way of passing on to everyone else in a group creating a spiral of bad feeling this often leads to conflict especially common as families get together at this time but positive feeling is also contagious no matter how bad my day has been if i come home to a friendly and relaxed atmosphere my mood immediately lifts

Anger is a secondary emotion it always stems from something else when i feel that anger wash over me when i feel the tears spill from my eyes the lighthouse that i have created is the word no inside my head i yell with force no once i halt the continuing rainfall of angry and negative thoughts in midstream i take several deep and cleansing breaths to stop the physical reaction of anger because anger always triggers a physical flight or fight response first that must be calmed so that i can deal with the feelings i then ask myself what the primary emotion is most likely for me it is a feeling of helplessness a loss of control once i recognize that emotion the root of it all i deal with it i deal with it in terms that are manageable and not overwhelming i acknowledge that i am helpless to change anyone else or to change the past but im not helpless in taking control of my life i am in control of not becoming a prisoner to the past

But… there’s no such thing as chance not really everything happens because of something else never randomly though it may appear to for example why did i go down that street and not the usual one because something made me – i may not know what it was but something made my brain make that decision nothing comes from nothing why does a coin land heads up because of physics not chance because of how it was spun or the air currents not because some random god controlled it “luck is just what we call it” says jack in wasted and he’s right that’s what luck is – just our name for events that we seem not to control

While the world at large says things like ‘good on you for following your dreams’ it stomps on us as it turns its back on us following your dreams is good because it makes you happy to do what you most want to do following your dreams is admirable because it’s hard following your dreams is hard because most people don’t and because most people put up with something else that something else becomes the norm which then makes it hard to stray from the standard path

The right to oral proceedings is based on the fact that an oral discussion has a nature different from a procedure in writing and i think that not only the applicant has to account for the possibility that the examining division changes its mind during the discussion but the examining divion also has to account for the possibility that it will be able to convince the applicant no matter how determined the applicant appears in writing depriving the applicant of his right to oral proceedings is clearly a violation of the right to be heard and i hope that this decision will remain isolated
However all drugs have side effects and it takes time to evaluate risks and benefits of new pharmacological agents in the case of drugs that interfere with brain functions it will be essential to think longterm in other words to take into account the primal health research perspective this is suggested by animal experiments such as those by carol kellogg who studied the longterm consequences on the offspring of diazepam – a widely used sedative drug acting on the gaba receptors one of the significant conclusions of her experiments is that exposure to this drug at the end of fetal life induces behavioural effects that do not become apparent in exposed animals until young adult ages there are other significant conclusions of these series of studies suggesting the need to think longterm when manipulating brain receptor during the early phases of development for example if male rats have been exposed to diazepam before being born the expected adolescent surge of testosterone does not occur

The defendant appealed to the us supreme court with justice byron white writing for the majority in a to decision the court held that for the plea agreement to be accepted the defendant must have been advised by a competent lawyer who was able to inform the individual that his best decision in the case would be to enter a guilty plea the court ruled that the defendant can enter such a plea “when he concludes that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly indicates guilt” the court only allowed the guilty plea with a simultaneous protestation of innocence as there was enough evidence to show that the prosecution had a strong case for a conviction and the defendant was entering such a plea to avoid this possible sentencing the court went on to note that even if the defendant could have shown that he would not have entered a guilty plea “but for” the rationale of receiving a lesser sentence the plea itself would not have been ruled invalid as a factual basis existed that could have supported alford’s conviction the supreme court held that his guilty plea was sustainable while the defendant himself still maintained that he was not guilty

This is what zen buddhism speaks of in its emphasis on nondualism – its not about choosing one pole over the other but in recognising that seeing the world in terms of pairs of opposites is not a helpful viewpoint or skillful means that this is a relative choice and that looking directly into the nature of everything perceiving the whole interconnectedness allows us to see that these are arbitrary distinctions that we make and that we have a choice about whether we buy into them or whether we choose to work to bring the poles together in ourselves and thus in the world
